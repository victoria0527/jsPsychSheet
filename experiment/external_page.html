            <p class="consent-text-block">Please read this document carefully before you decide to participate in this research study. <b>Your
                participation is voluntary, and you can decline to participate, or withdraw consent at any time,
                with no consequences. You must be 18 years or older to participate in this experiment.</b>

            <p class="consent-header">Study Title:</p>
            <p>Multisensory Metacognition: Probing Perceptual Confidence Using Audiovisual Stimuli</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Person(s) conducting the research:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Brian Odegaard, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology 
                Email: bodegaard@ufl.edu
                Phone: 352-392-0601
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Purpose of the research study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">The primary purpose of this study is to examine how effectively you can make judgments about audiovisual 
                stimuli and to evaluate how you rate confidence in things you have seen.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">What you will be asked to do in the study: </p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">First, you will be asked if you fulfill the eligibility criteria for this study, which include verifying 
                that you are 18 years or older, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, and do not have a history of seizures,  
                epilepsy, or stroke.  If you fulfill these criteria and agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sit in front of a computer 
                monitor with speakers placed on each side.  On each trial in this experiment, you may be asked to (1) report the number of beeps 
                and/or flashes that have been presented, and to also rate your confidence in what you have seen.  Or alternatively, (2) judge the 
                syllable that was spoken from short audiovisual video clips, and rate your confidence in your judgments about the video.  
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Time required:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">One session, which can last up to 60 Minutes</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Risks and benefits:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study. The risk to participants
                would not exceed anything that a participant may experience in everyday life. Very similar
                studies have been conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Brian Odegaard. There are no direct benefits of participation to you, but you will be 
                contributing to scientific knowledge about how the brain evaluates audiovisual stimuli.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Alternatives to participating in the study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">You may participate in other studies posted on SONA instead of this study.</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Confidentiality:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Your information will be assigned a 
                code number, and your name will not be attached to your data in any way, thus ensuring that your 
                responses will be completely anonymous.  Your name will not be used in any report.

                Only the researchers will have access to the information we collect online. There is a minimal risk that 
                security of any online data may be breached, but since no identifying information will be collected, and 
                the online host (SONA) uses several forms of encryption other protections, it is unlikely that a security 
                breach of the online data will result in any adverse consequence for you.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Compensation:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Participants who will be participating in this study through SONA as part of the participation 
                pool will receive 2 course credits for the 60 minute study.</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Withdrawal from the study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">You are free to withdraw your consent and to stop participating in this study at any time 
                without consequence.  If you withdraw, your information will not be used in any analysis.  The researcher also reserve 
                the right to withdraw you from the study for inattentiveness or task negligence.</b>
