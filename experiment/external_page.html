    Purpose of the research study:
    The primary purpose of this study is to examine how effectively 
    you can make judgments about audiovisual stimuli and to evaluate how you rate confidence in things you have seen.

    What you will be asked to do in the study: 
    First, you will be asked if you fulfill the eligibility criteria for this study,
    which include verifying that you are 18 years or older,
    have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, and do not have
    a history of seizures, epilepsy, or stroke.  If you fulfill these criteria
    and agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sit in front of
    a computer monitor with speakers placed on each side.
    On each trial in this experiment, you may be asked to
    (1) report the number of beeps and/or flashes that have been presented,
    and to also rate your confidence in what you have seen.
    Or alternatively, (2) judge the syllable that was spoken from short audiovisual video clips,
    and rate your confidence in your judgments about the video.
